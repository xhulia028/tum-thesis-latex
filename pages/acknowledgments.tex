I would like to express my sincere gratitude to my advisor, Samuel James Newcome, for his continuous support throughout this thesis. His guidance during our meetings and his willingness to answer every question—no matter how many emails I sent—were invaluable.  

I would also like to thank the Chair of Scientific Computing and Prof. Dr. Hans-Joachim Bungartz for providing the opportunity and resources to conduct this research.  

A heartfelt thank you to my family for always supporting me in every journey I embark on. Finally, I am deeply grateful to my friends, who patiently listened to me talk about my thesis for four months straight.
